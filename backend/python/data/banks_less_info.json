The process for generating a Green PIN is as follows: First, insert your card into the ATM card reader. Then, press the 'Green PIN' button followed by the 'Generate OTP' button. A 6-digit OTP code is generated and sent to your registered mobile number. Afterward, remove your card. Next, insert your card into the card reader again, press the 'Green PIN' button, and select the 'Set PIN' button. Enter the 6-digit OTP code you received on your registered mobile number and press OK. Finally, type a 4-digit 'New PIN' of your choice, retype it for confirmation, and press enter.

            "Security Tips for e-Commerce": "Tips for the secure usage of Credit/Debit cards over the internet, especially for online shopping, include always using secure websites for transactions and shopping. Look for security clues such as a lock image in the browser and a URL that starts with 'https:'—these signs indicate that your purchases are secured with encryption to protect account information. It's important to always shop with merchants you know and trust. After completing an online transaction, always log off from the website and delete your browser cookies. Be cautious with e-mail messages to avoid phishing scams; do not respond to e-mails asking for personal information, as banks do not request such details. Never send payment information via e-mail, as information traveling over the internet (like e-mail) may not be fully protected from being read by outside parties. Be careful when providing personal information online, and be wary of promotional scams. Identity thieves may use fraudulent offers asking for your personal details. Finally, keep your passwords, card numbers, CVV, and PIN secret. Some online stores may require registration with a username and password before making a purchase, and online passwords should be kept secret just like your ATM PIN.",

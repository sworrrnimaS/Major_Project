            "Security Tips for e-Commerce": "Tips for the secure usage of Credit/Debit cards over the internet, especially for online shopping, include always using secure websites for transactions and shopping. Look for security clues such as a lock image in the browser and a URL that starts with 'https:'—these signs indicate that your purchases are secured with encryption to protect account information. It's important to always shop with merchants you know and trust. After completing an online transaction, always log off from the website and delete your browser cookies. Be cautious with e-mail messages to avoid phishing scams; do not respond to e-mails asking for personal information, as banks do not request such details. Never send payment information via e-mail, as information traveling over the internet (like e-mail) may not be fully protected from being read by outside parties. Be careful when providing personal information online, and be wary of promotional scams. Identity thieves may use fraudulent offers asking for your personal details. Finally, keep your passwords, card numbers, CVV, and PIN secret. Some online stores may require registration with a username and password before making a purchase, and online passwords should be kept secret just like your ATM PIN.",

The bank, fully owned by Government of Nepal, was established on 10 Magh 2022 (23 January 1966) under the special statute 'Rastriya Banijya Bank Act, 2021' and had operated under 'Commercial Bank Act, 2031' until it was re-registered as a public limited company on 6 Baishak 2063 (19 May 2006). At present, the Bank operates as 'A' class financial institution licensed by Nepal Rastra Bank and carries out commercial banking activities as per the provisions of the 'Bank and Financial Institutions Act 2073,' (2017). RBBL endured many stressful years of business and faced existential questions at some point of time in the past. But learning the lessons from the events and craving towards the brighter future, the Bank successfully implemented a restructuring plan; and now it stands as one of the most preferred banks with the highest number of customers all 77 districts and 7 provinces of the country. The Bank has been able to imprint its presence in the national economy through efficient allocation of resources in all sectors of the economy thereby enhancing production and generating employment opportunities within the country. The unflinching faith and goodwill bestowed by our customers, continued support from the Government, well-wishers, and general public has been the reason for us to stand as the most trusted bank in the country.",

This placement makes the funds more liquid, often using techniques such as depositing cash into bank accounts, purchasing insurance products, or buying assets. 2. **Layering**: To conceal the illegal origin of the placed funds, the money must be moved, dispersed, and disguised. This activity is known as 'layering,' where money launderers may use multiple banks and accounts, hire professionals as intermediaries, or transact through corporations and trusts to obscure the funds' origin. 3. **Integration**: The final stage, called 'integration,' allows the 'cleaned' funds to be invested in legitimate or illegitimate businesses, giving the original 'dirty' money the appearance of legitimacy.",

            "Why is AML/CFT important?": "AML/CFT is important for the following reasons: 1. To protect the financial system; 2. To prevent criminals from enjoying the proceeds of crimes; 3. To prevent criminals from building formidable economic powers and challenging stability.",

The guidelines regarding customer relationships in the Bank broadly include: \n\n- No account shall be opened in names that alter from the primary identity document, nor in anonymous or fictitious (benami) names, blank names, or numeric/alphanumeric characters. \n- Accounts shall only be opened in the name of natural and legal persons/organizations, matching the primary identity document. Different account titles may be permitted at the written request of the legal person/organization, with appropriate control parameters. \n- Minimum required information and documents must be obtained prior to opening an account or engaging in any business relationship, in accordance with the AML Act, AML Rule, FIU Directives, NRB regulations, and Bank policies. \n- Necessary checks and verifications must be conducted to ensure the customer's identity does not match any person with a criminal background or banned entries such as terrorist individuals or organizations. \n- An account will not be opened if there are sufficient grounds to believe that the identity of the prospective customer cannot be verified, or the customer fails to disclose required information regarding identity, reasons for opening the account, transaction frequency and volume, etc. Refusals must be documented and communicated to the HO AML Compliance Officer through the Branch AML Compliance Officer. \n- Existing accounts may be frozen if staff are unable to apply appropriate customer due diligence due to lack of cooperation or unreliable information from the customer. Closure decisions must be approved by Senior Management and notified to the customer, with closure also reported to the FIU in writing. \n- The Bank shall not establish business relationships with shell companies or institutions dealing with shell companies and shall discontinue any identified relationships with institutions allowing transactions of shell banks. \n- The Bank shall not associate with entities located in non-cooperative jurisdictions as identified by the FATF or those sanctioned by agencies like the UN, OFAC, HMT, EU, etc. \n- Implementation of CAP should not be overly restrictive, preventing banking services to financially or socially disadvantaged individuals. \n- Opening accounts for Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and Persons in Influential Positions (PlPs) requires approval from senior management, with information about such accounts provided to the AML Compliance Officer at HO.",
            "What are the customer identification procedures?": "Customer identification/verification means identifying the customer and verifying his/her identity using reliable, independent source documents, data, or information to the Bank's satisfaction.

            "When to identify or verify the customers?": "While establishing a banking relationship. While opening the account. While transferring funds through wire transfers. Whenever the Bank feels that it is necessary to obtain additional information from existing customers based on the conduct or behavior of the account. When the bank sells third party products as an agent. When high risk customers and politically exposed persons conduct each transaction. When the bank has a doubt about the authenticity, veracity, or adequacy of the previously obtained customer identification data. Customer identification shall also be carried out in respect of non-account holders approaching the bank for high value one-off transactions. Any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose significant reputational or other risks to the Bank.",
            "What is Customer Due Diligence (CDD)?": "Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is a process of identifying the customer and verifying that customer’s identity using reliable, independent source documents, data, or information. It includes: \n\n1. Identifying customers, including beneficial owners; \n2. Gathering information on customers and beneficial owners and creating a customer risk profile; \n3. Applying established customer acceptance policies to new customers; \n4. Maintaining customer and beneficial owner information on an ongoing basis; \n5. Monitoring the customer’s transactions and relationship with the customer on an ongoing basis.",
            "Why is KYC/CDD important?": "It allows institutions to know and understand their customers and their transactions better, which in turn allows institutions to intercept any fraudulent dealing.",
            "When does KYC apply?": "Opening a new account (deposit/borrowal), opening a subsequent account where documents are not submitted, opening a locker facility, when the bank feels it is necessary to obtain additional information, after periodic intervals based on RBI instructions, and when there are changes to signatories, mandate holders, or beneficial owners.",
            "What are the types of CDD?": "Simplified CDD is the lowest level of due diligence for customers in the low-risk category. Normal CDD is applied to general or medium risk customers who do not fall under high risk or low risk categories. Enhanced CDD is applied to high-risk customers, requiring collection of additional information and surveillance during transactions.",
            "When to update/review KYC?": "Update and review of a customer shall be based on the risk as follows: a. High risk: one year, b. Medium risk: three years, c. Low risk: five years.",
            "Who are Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)?": "PEPs means politically exposed persons and includes both domestic and international PEPs. Domestic PEPs include the President, Vice President, Ministers, Members of parliaments, Officers of the Constitutional Bodies, Judges of the different courts, Senior politicians, Members of national political parties, Officers of a special class of Government of Nepal, and Senior executives of any institutions partially or fully owned by the government. International PEPs include Head of state or government, Senior politicians, Central members of political parties, Senior government officials, Judiciary officials, Military officials, and Diplomats.",
            "Why screen PEPs customers?": "PEPs are high risk customers, so each customer should be screened against the PEPs list. If any customer falls under it, approval from high authority should be taken before opening the account.",
            "What is STR?": "STR means Suspicious Transaction Report. Suspicious transactions are those that deviate from the profile, characteristics, and usual transaction patterns, or are reasonably suspected to have been conducted to evade reporting or involve funds alleged to be attributable to predicate offences. Suspicious transactions should be reported within 3 days of arriving at the conclusion that the transaction is suspicious.",
            "What are STR triggers?": "Cash transactions that may be suspicious include: cash transactions conducted in an unusual amount, relatively small amounts but with high frequency, transactions conducted using several different individual names for the interest of a particular person, purchase of several insurance products in cash in a short period or simultaneously with premium payment in a large amount followed by policy surrender prior to the due date, and purchase of securities by cash, transfer, or checks under another person’s name. Economically irrational transactions could involve transactions having no conformity with the initial purpose of account opening, having no relationship with the business of the relevant customer, transaction amounts and frequencies different from those normally conducted by the customer, receipts/payments of funds using more than one account, fund transfers using the account of reporting entities' employees in an unusual amount, and multiple inward or outward remittance transactions conducted with a person from countries or regions where terrorist organizations operate. Fund transfers that may raise suspicion include fund transfers to and from high-risk offshore financial centers without clear business purposes, receipts of fund transfers in several phases, subsequently transferred entirely to another account, and receipts and transfers of funds at the same or approximately the same amount conducted in a relatively short period (pass-by). Customer behaviors that may indicate suspicion include unreasonable behaviors of the customer when conducting a transaction (e.g., nervous, rushed, unconfident), unusual curiosity about internal systems, controls, and reporting, providing false information regarding identity, sources of income, or businesses, using unreliable or allegedly fake identification documents (e.g., different signature or photo), and opening an account for a short period.",
            "What is TTR?": "Threshold transactions include credit and debit transactions of NPR 1 million or more in the account of any person or entity, particularly cooperatives, private companies, or NGOs, either by single or multiple transactions in a day. It also includes payments of remittances of NPR 1 million or more by any person or entity through single or multiple transactions in a day and exchange transactions of NPR 500,000 or more provided to any person or entity through single or multiple transactions in a day. Threshold transactions should be reported within 15 days.",
            "What is tipping off?": "Tipping off refers to informing clients that their account is being monitored or disclosing to them that there is suspicion regarding a transaction. When an institution identifies a suspicious transaction, the customer should not be 'tipped off' or informed.",
            "What are the penalties for non-compliance of AML/CFT?": "Penalties for non-compliance can include fines ranging from NPR 1 million to NPR 50 million for financial institutions and NPR 100,000 to NPR 10 million for others, full or partial restrictions on business, suspension or cancellation of registration/permission/license, and other appropriate sanctions.",
            "What is risk classification of the customers?": "For proper risk assessment of business relationships with customers, all new customers are categorized as High risk, Medium risk, or Low risk. This classification is meant for proper monitoring of accounts and does not reflect on the account holders themselves. Risk categorization should not be disclosed to customers.",
            "Who are high risk customers?": "High risk customers include those identified as high risk based on a higher rank of risk scoring by the RBA module in screening results and KYC risk profiling in the AML/CFT IT System, as well as those from high risk countries categorized by FATF. This also includes accounts classified as high risk by FIU-NRB, customers or transactions linked to jurisdictions deficient in controlling crimes such as terrorism financing, money laundering, corruption, and human trafficking. Additionally, non face-to-face customers, politically exposed persons (PEPs), antique dealers, money service bureaus, dealers in arms, casinos, and organizations receiving donations are also considered high risk. Customers under investigation or prosecution, those with suspected beneficial owners, and STR reported customers are classified as high risk.",
            "Who are low risk customers?": "Low risk customers are those whose identity and source of income are clearly disclosed, and their transactions do not raise any suspicion. Typically, these include salaried employees or pensioners with well-defined salary structures, individuals from lower economic strata with small account balances and low turnover, accounts with annual turnover less than NPR 1 Lakh, government departments and owned companies, and borrower accounts not classified as high or medium risk.",
            "What type of transactions are non face to face transactions?": "Non face to face transactions include business relationships concluded over the Internet, services and transactions over the Internet, use of ATM machines, telephone banking, transmission of instructions via fax, and electronic point of sale transactions using prepaid or reloadable cards.",
            "Who is a beneficial owner?": "A beneficial owner is the natural person or persons who ultimately own or control a customer and/or the person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. It includes those who exercise ultimate effective control over a legal entity or arrangement.",
            "Why identify beneficial owners?": "Identifying beneficial owners is crucial because the person in whose name an account is opened may not be the one who ultimately controls or is entitled to the funds. Understanding the ultimate level of control is essential for effective anti-money laundering efforts.",
            "How long should transaction records of customers be kept?": "Banks must keep a record of every transaction, customer and beneficial owner data, and related information for a minimum of 5 years. This includes KYC/CDD documents, correspondence, sources of funds, and files on suspicious activity reports."

The Land Reform Savings Corporation was merged with ADBN in 1973. Subsequent amendments to the Act empowered the bank to extend credit to small farmers under group liability and expand the scope of financing to promote cottage industries. The amendments also permitted the bank to engage in commercial banking activities for the mobilization of domestic resources.The bank worked as a premier rural credit institution since its establishment, contributing substantial agricultural credit supply in the country. Rural finance has been the principal operational area of ADBN in the past. However, the bank is also involved in commercial banking operations since 1984, to provide commercial banking services.",

Addressing this demand without the commercialization and diversification of the subsistence agriculture system is almost impossible. It is imperative for all stakeholders to collaborate across their sectors to support the enhancement and development of agriculture. The Agricultural Development Bank, established as an advantage bank for flowing agricultural loans in the country, has reached a stage where it has taken on significant responsibilities. The bank has facilitated various loan instruments in fund management for the operation of agricultural and animal husbandry-related businesses. By continuing to provide various loan facilities related to agriculture and animal husbandry, the bank meets the ongoing demand and expectations of farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs at all levels.",

When you use your card at an ATM, enter your PIN in such a way that no one can memorize your PIN. Don't leave your receipt behind at the ATM. Your PIN and account number from a discarded receipt could make you vulnerable to credit card fraud. Also, don't throw out your credit card statement, receipts without first shredding them. Never give your credit card number over the telephone unless you initiated the call. Even when you place the call to a legitimate merchant, never give out your card number over a cordless phone. One common scam is when someone calls you back right after you place an order, claims to be from the merchant and tells you that there was a problem with your card number, so would you mind giving it to them again? The safest thing to do is to ask them to read out the number they have, and then change any incorrect numbers. Make certain you get your card back after you make a purchase (one good habit to observe is to leave your wallet open in your hand until you have the card back). Also, make sure that you personally rip up any voided or cancelled charge slips. Always keep a list of your credit cards, credit card numbers and support service numbers handy, in case your card is stolen or lost. Check your monthly statements to make certain all transactions are your own, and notify the card issuer of any unauthorized transactions immediately.",

        "about_us": "Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) , the first bank of Nepal proudly holds the glory of marking the formal beginning of banking system in Nepal. Nepal Bank Limited was established as FIRST bank of Nepal on Kartik 30, 1994 (November 15, 1937 A.D.) under Nepal Bank Act 1937. The bank was established with an authorized capital of Rs.10 million, issued capital of Rs.2.5 million and paid up capital of Rs.0.842 million. The share held by government and private sector was 60% and 40% respectively. Noteablly, Nepal Bank Limited was inaugurated by King Tribhuvan with supportive vision of Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana to institutionalize formal banking system in Nepal. Before the establishment of NBL, all monetary transactions were carried out by private dealers and trading centers. It was the time when there was no trust for such formal banking system. This reflected in under subscription of shares (OnlyRs.0.842 million could be raised out of floated capital of Rs.2.5 million). Raising deposit and mobilizing the collected deposit was even more difficult. Absence of any bank in Nepal was hampering the economic progress of the country. This was taken into consideration by Nepal Bank Limited with key focus on overcoming such economic hamper and difficulties of general public. This was initiated by providing banking services to people removing their inconvenience. This objective got better and bigger with the time. Nepal Bank Limited has so far adopted according to the technological changes, national economic welfare, customer preferences in services, market competition and global financial scenarios to become a leading, glorious and highly reputed bank of Nepal.",

The Bank was rechristened as NIC ASIA Bank after the merger of NIC Bank with Bank of Asia Nepal on 30th June 2013. This was a historic merger in the annals of the Nepalese financial landscape as the first of its kind merger between two successful commercial banks in the country. Today, NIC ASIA has established itself as one of the most successful commercial banks in Nepal.During the post-merger integration phase, NIC ASIA managed the transition very smoothly receiving accolades from the regulators as well as the stakeholders, paving the way for other mergers and consolidation in the Nepalese financial sector.After the merger, NIC ASIA was recognized as “Bank of the Year 2013-Nepal” by The Banker, Financial Times, UK.  This is the second time that the Bank was recognized with this prestigious award, the previous occasion being in 2007.",

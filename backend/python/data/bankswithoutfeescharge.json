The bank, fully owned by Government of Nepal, was established on 10 Magh 2022 (23 January 1966) under the special statute 'Rastriya Banijya Bank Act, 2021' and had operated under 'Commercial Bank Act, 2031' until it was re-registered as a public limited company on 6 Baishak 2063 (19 May 2006). At present, the Bank operates as 'A' class financial institution licensed by Nepal Rastra Bank and carries out commercial banking activities as per the provisions of the 'Bank and Financial Institutions Act 2073,' (2017). RBBL endured many stressful years of business and faced existential questions at some point of time in the past. But learning the lessons from the events and craving towards the brighter future, the Bank successfully implemented a restructuring plan; and now it stands as one of the most preferred banks with the highest number of customers all 77 districts and 7 provinces of the country. The Bank has been able to imprint its presence in the national economy through efficient allocation of resources in all sectors of the economy thereby enhancing production and generating employment opportunities within the country. The unflinching faith and goodwill bestowed by our customers, continued support from the Government, well-wishers, and general public has been the reason for us to stand as the most trusted bank in the country.",

            "How does money laundering work?": "Money laundering works in three stages: 1. **Placement**: Illegal funds or assets are first brought into the financial system. This placement makes the funds more liquid, often using techniques such as depositing cash into bank accounts, purchasing insurance products, or buying assets. 2. **Layering**: To conceal the illegal origin of the placed funds, the money must be moved, dispersed, and disguised. This activity is known as 'layering,' where money launderers may use multiple banks and accounts, hire professionals as intermediaries, or transact through corporations and trusts to obscure the funds' origin. 3. **Integration**: The final stage, called 'integration,' allows the 'cleaned' funds to be invested in legitimate or illegitimate businesses, giving the original 'dirty' money the appearance of legitimacy.",

            "What is the difference between Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing?": "Money Laundering involves disguising funds derived from illegal activity so they may be used without detection of the illegal activity, whereas Terrorist Financing involves the use of legally derived money to carry out illegal activities.",
            "Why is AML/CFT important?": "AML/CFT is important for the following reasons: 1. To protect the financial system; 2. To prevent criminals from enjoying the proceeds of crimes; 3. To prevent criminals from building formidable economic powers and challenging stability.",

            "When to identify or verify the customers?": "While establishing a banking relationship. While opening the account. While transferring funds through wire transfers. Whenever the Bank feels that it is necessary to obtain additional information from existing customers based on the conduct or behavior of the account. When the bank sells third party products as an agent. When high risk customers and politically exposed persons conduct each transaction. When the bank has a doubt about the authenticity, veracity, or adequacy of the previously obtained customer identification data. Customer identification shall also be carried out in respect of non-account holders approaching the bank for high value one-off transactions. Any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose significant reputational or other risks to the Bank.",
            "What is Customer Due Diligence (CDD)?": "Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is a process of identifying the customer and verifying that customer’s identity using reliable, independent source documents, data, or information. It includes: \n\n1. Identifying customers, including beneficial owners; \n2. Gathering information on customers and beneficial owners and creating a customer risk profile; \n3. Applying established customer acceptance policies to new customers; \n4. Maintaining customer and beneficial owner information on an ongoing basis; \n5. Monitoring the customer’s transactions and relationship with the customer on an ongoing basis.",
            "Why is KYC/CDD important?": "It allows institutions to know and understand their customers and their transactions better, which in turn allows institutions to intercept any fraudulent dealing.",
            "When does KYC apply?": "Opening a new account (deposit/borrowal), opening a subsequent account where documents are not submitted, opening a locker facility, when the bank feels it is necessary to obtain additional information, after periodic intervals based on RBI instructions, and when there are changes to signatories, mandate holders, or beneficial owners.",
            "What are the types of CDD?": "Simplified CDD is the lowest level of due diligence for customers in the low-risk category. Normal CDD is applied to general or medium risk customers who do not fall under high risk or low risk categories. Enhanced CDD is applied to high-risk customers, requiring collection of additional information and surveillance during transactions.",
            "When to update/review KYC?": "Update and review of a customer shall be based on the risk as follows: a. High risk: one year, b. Medium risk: three years, c. Low risk: five years.",

International PEPs include Head of state or government, Senior politicians, Central members of political parties, Senior government officials, Judiciary officials, Military officials, and Diplomats.",
            "Why screen PEPs customers?": "PEPs are high risk customers, so each customer should be screened against the PEPs list. If any customer falls under it, approval from high authority should be taken before opening the account.",
            "What is STR?": "STR means Suspicious Transaction Report. Suspicious transactions are those that deviate from the profile, characteristics, and usual transaction patterns, or are reasonably suspected to have been conducted to evade reporting or involve funds alleged to be attributable to predicate offences. Suspicious transactions should be reported within 3 days of arriving at the conclusion that the transaction is suspicious.",
            "What are STR triggers?": "Cash transactions that may be suspicious include: cash transactions conducted in an unusual amount, relatively small amounts but with high frequency, transactions conducted using several different individual names for the interest of a particular person, purchase of several insurance products in cash in a short period or simultaneously with premium payment in a large amount followed by policy surrender prior to the due date, and purchase of securities by cash, transfer, or checks under another person’s name. Economically irrational transactions could involve transactions having no conformity with the initial purpose of account opening, having no relationship with the business of the relevant customer, transaction amounts and frequencies different from those normally conducted by the customer, receipts/payments of funds using more than one account, fund transfers using the account of reporting entities' employees in an unusual amount, and multiple inward or outward remittance transactions conducted with a person from countries or regions where terrorist organizations operate. Fund transfers that may raise suspicion include fund transfers to and from high-risk offshore financial centers without clear business purposes, receipts of fund transfers in several phases, subsequently transferred entirely to another account, and receipts and transfers of funds at the same or approximately the same amount conducted in a relatively short period (pass-by). Customer behaviors that may indicate suspicion include unreasonable behaviors of the customer when conducting a transaction (e.g., nervous, rushed, unconfident), unusual curiosity about internal systems, controls, and reporting, providing false information regarding identity, sources of income, or businesses, using unreliable or allegedly fake identification documents (e.g., different signature or photo), and opening an account for a short period.",
            "What is TTR?": "Threshold transactions include credit and debit transactions of NPR 1 million or more in the account of any person or entity, particularly cooperatives, private companies, or NGOs, either by single or multiple transactions in a day. It also includes payments of remittances of NPR 1 million or more by any person or entity through single or multiple transactions in a day and exchange transactions of NPR 500,000 or more provided to any person or entity through single or multiple transactions in a day. Threshold transactions should be reported within 15 days.",
            "What is tipping off?": "Tipping off refers to informing clients that their account is being monitored or disclosing to them that there is suspicion regarding a transaction. When an institution identifies a suspicious transaction, the customer should not be 'tipped off' or informed.",
            "What are the penalties for non-compliance of AML/CFT?": "Penalties for non-compliance can include fines ranging from NPR 1 million to NPR 50 million for financial institutions and NPR 100,000 to NPR 10 million for others, full or partial restrictions on business, suspension or cancellation of registration/permission/license, and other appropriate sanctions.",
            "What is risk classification of the customers?": "For proper risk assessment of business relationships with customers, all new customers are categorized as High risk, Medium risk, or Low risk. This classification is meant for proper monitoring of accounts and does not reflect on the account holders themselves. Risk categorization should not be disclosed to customers.",
            "Who are high risk customers?": "High risk customers include those identified as high risk based on a higher rank of risk scoring by the RBA module in screening results and KYC risk profiling in the AML/CFT IT System, as well as those from high risk countries categorized by FATF. This also includes accounts classified as high risk by FIU-NRB, customers or transactions linked to jurisdictions deficient in controlling crimes such as terrorism financing, money laundering, corruption, and human trafficking. Additionally, non face-to-face customers, politically exposed persons (PEPs), antique dealers, money service bureaus, dealers in arms, casinos, and organizations receiving donations are also considered high risk. Customers under investigation or prosecution, those with suspected beneficial owners, and STR reported customers are classified as high risk.",
            "Who are low risk customers?": "Low risk customers are those whose identity and source of income are clearly disclosed, and their transactions do not raise any suspicion. Typically, these include salaried employees or pensioners with well-defined salary structures, individuals from lower economic strata with small account balances and low turnover, accounts with annual turnover less than NPR 1 Lakh, government departments and owned companies, and borrower accounts not classified as high or medium risk.",
            "What type of transactions are non face to face transactions?": "Non face to face transactions include business relationships concluded over the Internet, services and transactions over the Internet, use of ATM machines, telephone banking, transmission of instructions via fax, and electronic point of sale transactions using prepaid or reloadable cards.",
            "Who is a beneficial owner?": "A beneficial owner is the natural person or persons who ultimately own or control a customer and/or the person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. It includes those who exercise ultimate effective control over a legal entity or arrangement.",
            "Why identify beneficial owners?": "Identifying beneficial owners is crucial because the person in whose name an account is opened may not be the one who ultimately controls or is entitled to the funds. Understanding the ultimate level of control is essential for effective anti-money laundering efforts.",
            "How long should transaction records of customers be kept?": "Banks must keep a record of every transaction, customer and beneficial owner data, and related information for a minimum of 5 years. This includes KYC/CDD documents, correspondence, sources of funds, and files on suspicious activity reports."

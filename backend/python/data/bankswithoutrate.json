The Land Reform Savings Corporation was merged with ADBN in 1973. Subsequent amendments to the Act empowered the bank to extend credit to small farmers under group liability and expand the scope of financing to promote cottage industries. The amendments also permitted the bank to engage in commercial banking activities for the mobilization of domestic resources.The bank worked as a premier rural credit institution since its establishment, contributing substantial agricultural credit supply in the country. Rural finance has been the principal operational area of ADBN in the past. However, the bank is also involved in commercial banking operations since 1984, to provide commercial banking services.",

Addressing this demand without the commercialization and diversification of the subsistence agriculture system is almost impossible. It is imperative for all stakeholders to collaborate across their sectors to support the enhancement and development of agriculture. The Agricultural Development Bank, established as an advantage bank for flowing agricultural loans in the country, has reached a stage where it has taken on significant responsibilities. The bank has facilitated various loan instruments in fund management for the operation of agricultural and animal husbandry-related businesses. By continuing to provide various loan facilities related to agriculture and animal husbandry, the bank meets the ongoing demand and expectations of farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs at all levels.",

It is an alternative payment method to cash and cheques, which enable you to pay directly during purchases of goods and services from merchants (POS Outlets) or draw cash from ATM terminals. EBL Card product, affiliated with SmartChoice Technologies (SCT) with co-branding of Union Pay International (UPI). The card allows you to draw cash from SCT Network & UPI affiliated ATMs in Nepal and NPCI affiliated ATMs in India. It can be used for payments at merchant locations within Nepal and India. Instant issuance is available, and there are no charges for using the EBL Debit card at ATMs or for purchases at POS outlets. SCT Debit cards are issued free of cost to all Saving Premium account holders. For card service fees, the charges associated with the SCT – UPI Card and VISA Card include a Card Issuance Fee that offers two options: Option 1 for an upfront payment of Rs. 1500, or Option 2 for installment payments of Rs. 400 every year for four years. Additionally, there are no charges for Card Replacement, Card Re-Issuance, or PIN Re-Generation. For transaction fees, the fees for using SCT-UPI and VISA Cards include no charges for cash withdrawals from EBL ATMs, while withdrawals from ATMs in Nepal incur a fee of Rs. 15, and withdrawals from ATMs in India carry a charge of Rs. 300. Balance inquiries at EBL ATMs are free, but inquiries at ATMs in Nepal and India cost Rs. 15 and Rs. 50, respectively. Purchases made at POS terminals are also free of charge. Moreover, a 0.15% fee is levied on transactions done in India for exchange trading. To apply for a debit card, you need to collect the 'Debit Card Application Form' from any EBL branch or download it online. After filling out the form for the desired card type (either SCT or Visa), submit it to the respective branch. Once processed, you can collect your card and PIN code on the same day for an Instant card (Non-personalized), or on the specified day for an Embossed card (Personalized). To use the card, start by memorizing your PIN and, for SCT cards, changing the provided PIN at an ATM. For Visa cards, changing the PIN is not compulsory, but it's recommended. To make payments at merchant outlets, hand over your card at the POS terminal, where the merchant will swipe it, and you'll enter your PIN. After that, sign two receipts—one for you and one for the merchant. For cash withdrawals at ATMs, insert your card, enter the PIN, and select the withdrawal amount. Always ensure to take your card, cash, and receipt. If your card is lost or stolen, report it immediately to block further usage, and apply for a replacement at the bank. For safety, treat your card like cash, sign the signature panel, memorize and securely store your PIN, and periodically change it. Never share your PIN or allow others to use your card. Always keep your card in safe custody, check your account regularly, and report any discrepancies to the bank within 30 days.

        "about_us": "Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) , the first bank of Nepal proudly holds the glory of marking the formal beginning of banking system in Nepal. Nepal Bank Limited was established as FIRST bank of Nepal on Kartik 30, 1994 (November 15, 1937 A.D.) under Nepal Bank Act 1937. The bank was established with an authorized capital of Rs.10 million, issued capital of Rs.2.5 million and paid up capital of Rs.0.842 million. The share held by government and private sector was 60% and 40% respectively. Noteablly, Nepal Bank Limited was inaugurated by King Tribhuvan with supportive vision of Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana to institutionalize formal banking system in Nepal. Before the establishment of NBL, all monetary transactions were carried out by private dealers and trading centers. It was the time when there was no trust for such formal banking system. This reflected in under subscription of shares (OnlyRs.0.842 million could be raised out of floated capital of Rs.2.5 million). Raising deposit and mobilizing the collected deposit was even more difficult. Absence of any bank in Nepal was hampering the economic progress of the country. This was taken into consideration by Nepal Bank Limited with key focus on overcoming such economic hamper and difficulties of general public. This was initiated by providing banking services to people removing their inconvenience. This objective got better and bigger with the time. Nepal Bank Limited has so far adopted according to the technological changes, national economic welfare, customer preferences in services, market competition and global financial scenarios to become a leading, glorious and highly reputed bank of Nepal.",

The Bank was rechristened as NIC ASIA Bank after the merger of NIC Bank with Bank of Asia Nepal on 30th June 2013. This was a historic merger in the annals of the Nepalese financial landscape as the first of its kind merger between two successful commercial banks in the country. Today, NIC ASIA has established itself as one of the most successful commercial banks in Nepal.During the post-merger integration phase, NIC ASIA managed the transition very smoothly receiving accolades from the regulators as well as the stakeholders, paving the way for other mergers and consolidation in the Nepalese financial sector.After the merger, NIC ASIA was recognized as “Bank of the Year 2013-Nepal” by The Banker, Financial Times, UK.  This is the second time that the Bank was recognized with this prestigious award, the previous occasion being in 2007.",

The bank, fully owned by Government of Nepal, was established on 10 Magh 2022 (23 January 1966) under the special statute 'Rastriya Banijya Bank Act, 2021' and had operated under 'Commercial Bank Act, 2031' until it was re-registered as a public limited company on 6 Baishak 2063 (19 May 2006). At present, the Bank operates as 'A' class financial institution licensed by Nepal Rastra Bank and carries out commercial banking activities as per the provisions of the 'Bank and Financial Institutions Act 2073,' (2017). RBBL endured many stressful years of business and faced existential questions at some point of time in the past. But learning the lessons from the events and craving towards the brighter future, the Bank successfully implemented a restructuring plan; and now it stands as one of the most preferred banks with the highest number of customers all 77 districts and 7 provinces of the country. The Bank has been able to imprint its presence in the national economy through efficient allocation of resources in all sectors of the economy thereby enhancing production and generating employment opportunities within the country. The unflinching faith and goodwill bestowed by our customers, continued support from the Government, well-wishers, and general public has been the reason for us to stand as the most trusted bank in the country.",
